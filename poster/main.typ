#let introduction = secblock(fill: COLOR_BLUE)[
  = The need for new tools
  Tools must be *flexible* and *extensible* to accommodate the needs of modern
  research. Current spectral fitting solutions lack these aspects, with brittle
  codebases, dated architectures, and monolithic distributions. The best ideas
  that get you from A to B are not necessarily the best ideas to get you from B
  to C. Frequentist thinking has been largely replaced with *Bayesian
  approaches*, and even within the Bayesian approach, the *standard techniques
  are shifting* from Monte-Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) to normalising flows.
  SpectralFitting is designed to be able to keep up with the changes in
  optimization approaches, visualisation preferences, and statistical theory
  using a series of simple APIs.

  In the era of ever higher resolution and high volume astronomical data, the
  *computational performance* of models is crucial to avoid bottlenecks in a
  fitting. Modern spectral fitting tools *must take advantage* of the massively
  *parallel architectures* available on modern hardware. As SpectralFitting is
  written in the Julia programming language, the tool is portable and scalable
  over a wide variety of machines.

#let modular_design = secblock(fill: COLOR_RED)[
  = Modules and FFI
  The modular design of SpectralFitting, along with Julia's *foreign function
  interface (FFI)*, make existing models in other programming language
  available to the user. We have cross-compiled and wrapped the entire XSPEC
  model library with BinaryBuilder.jl for lazily-loaded distribution. We use
  the built-in Julia *package manager Pkg.jl* with a domain-specific registry
  to distribute user models and data.

  SpectralFitting has *four principle APIs*. Each is designed to be pluggable
  and permit down-stream packages to *alter and extend* the behaviour of the
  package in a robust way.

#let models = secblock(fill: COLOR_GREEN)[
  = Differentiable models
  Julia has excellent support for *automatic differentiation (AD)*, enabling the evaluation of derivatives in tandem with the model. The derivative information can be used by the *numerical optimizer*, permitting the use of advanced optimization algorithms, and reducing inference time.

  ```julia
  Base.@kwdef struct MyModel{T} <:

      "Some Parameter"
      p1::T = FitParam(3.0, lowerbound = 0.0)
  end
  SpectralFitting.invoke!(out, domain, m::MyModel)
      # model implementation here

  # calculate derivatives via Automatic Differentiation
  gradient(
    x -> invokemodel(domain, MyModel(;p1 = x)),
    3.0
  )
  ```

  The Julia Number abstraction allows us to also use the *Measurements.jl* or *Unitful.jl* packages to propagate uncertainties or units seamlessly.

#let surrogates = secblock(fill: COLOR_GREEN)[
  = Surrogates and Machine Learning
  Surrogate spectral models are *machine learned* proxies for a model
  component, useful when performance is bottlenecked, or differentiability is
  needed. Surrogates are trained to replicate the output space of a model, or
  can be used in *amalgamation (hybrid) with the underlying model* to learn the
  manifold of the *fit statistics* and help *optimize the fit*.

    = Abstract
    We present SpectralFitting, an *open-source*, work-in-progress package for the
    *Julia programming language* that aims to modernise the spectral fitting process.
    Our approach is to create modular, lazily-loaded, strictly reproducible and
    easily distributable software that can fully utilize available computational
    resources. We aim to *unite existing analysis tooling* across the electromagnetic
    spectrum, to provide a single tool that can fit large volumes of
    multi-wavelength data, with a choice of optimization algorithms and hardware
    acceleration. Our initial focus is on X-ray data. We welcome collaboration and comments.
